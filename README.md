## Mea culpa - I misunderstood where to check in

During week-06 and week-07, I was creating new repos per project [in my personal github account](https://github.com/danielthestranger?tab=repositories), and pushing my coursework there.

From week-08's MySQL exercises onwards, I'm working in this repo under green-fox-academy.
